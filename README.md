## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reusable workflow unit for an AI agent—typically a combination of:

- **Clear objective**: What success looks like and how to measure it
- **Input/output schema**: Well-defined data structures and formats
- **Steps & constraints**: Explicit instructions and boundaries
- **Tool usage conventions**: How and when to use specific tools
- **Tests & evaluation criteria**: Methods to verify correctness and quality

Skills enable AI agents to perform specialized tasks consistently and reliably across different platforms and contexts.

## By Platform

### Codex

**Codex** is OpenAI's AI-powered coding assistant that works across CLI and IDE extensions. Codex Skills extend the platform with task-specific capabilities through bundled instructions, resources, and optional scripts.

Skills are packaged as folders that encapsulate reusable workflows; for the shared structure, see [Creating Skills](#creating-skills) → [Skill Structure](#skill-structure).

**Installation Locations:**

Skills load hierarchically (highest precedence first):

| Scope  | Location                   | Use Case                            |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| REPO   | `$CWD/.codex/skills`       | Task-specific for current directory |
| REPO   | `$CWD/../.codex/skills`    | Shared for nested repositories      |
| REPO   | `$REPO_ROOT/.codex/skills` | Organization-wide skills            |
| USER   | `$CODEX_HOME/skills`       | Personal cross-project skills       |
| ADMIN  | `/etc/codex/skills`        | System-level for all users          |
| SYSTEM | Bundled                    | Default skills                      |

**Creating Skills:**

*Using the Skill Creator:*
```bash
$skill-creator
```
The built-in tool guides you through defining triggers and structure.

*Manual Creation:* Follow the shared template in [Creating Skills](#creating-skills) → [Basic Skill Template](#basic-skill-template). Common Codex frontmatter limits are `name` max 100 chars and `description` max 500 chars; restart Codex to load.

**Invoking Skills:**
- **Explicit**: Type `$skill-name` or use `/skills` command
- **Implicit**: Codex auto-activates based on description match

**Installing Additional Skills:**
```bash
$skill-installer linear
$skill-installer notion-spec-to-implementation
```

For docs, see [Resources](#resources) → [Official Documentation](#official-documentation).

See: [skills/codex/](skills/codex/) for Codex-specific skill examples.

### Claude Code

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude's capabilities directly into your terminal and development workflow. Agent Skills extend Claude with task-specific capabilities through organized instructions, scripts, and resources.

**What Are Agent Skills:**

Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Each Skill packages instructions, metadata, and optional resources that Claude automatically uses when relevant. Skills follow the open agent skills standard and work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, Claude API, and Claude Agent SDK.

**Why Use Skills:**
- **Specialize Claude**: Tailor capabilities for specific domain tasks
- **Reduce Repetition**: Build once, use automatically
- **Compose Functionality**: Combine Skills for complex workflows

For the shared Skill structure, see [Creating Skills](#creating-skills) → [Skill Structure](#skill-structure).

**YAML Frontmatter (Required):**
```yaml
---
name: your-skill-name
description: What this Skill does and when to use it
---
```

Requirements:
- `name`: Max 64 chars, lowercase/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words
- `description`: Max 1024 chars, non-empty, no XML tags

**Progressive Disclosure - Three Loading Levels:**

Skills use a three-level loading system to efficiently manage context:

| Level                     | When Loaded          | Token Cost            | Content                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1: Metadata**     | Always (at startup)  | ~100 tokens per Skill | `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter              |
| **Level 2: Instructions** | When Skill triggered | <5k tokens            | SKILL.md body with instructions and guidance                |
| **Level 3+: Resources**   | As needed            | Virtually unlimited   | Bundled files accessed via bash, no context cost until read |

Claude only loads what's needed for each task, keeping context usage efficient.

**Installation Locations:**

*For Claude Code (User-Level):*
```bash
# Create user-level skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code/skills/

# Copy skill folder to the skills directory
cp -r your_skill_name ~/.config/claude-code/skills/

# Verify the skill is recognized
claude --list-skills
```

*For Project-Specific:*
```bash
# Create project-level skills directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills/

# Copy skill to project
cp -r your_skill_name .claude/skills/
```

Skills in `.claude/skills/` are only available for that specific project, while skills in `~/.config/claude-code/skills/` are available globally.

**Creating Skills:**

Follow the shared template in [Creating Skills](#creating-skills) → [Basic Skill Template](#basic-skill-template) and respect the `name` / `description` constraints above; then copy into the appropriate directory and validate with `claude --list-skills`.

**How Skills Are Discovered:**

1. **Startup**: Load all Skill metadata (name + description)
2. **Task Matching**: Requests matching a description auto-trigger the Skill
3. **On-demand loading**: Read SKILL.md and other bundled resources only when needed

**Best Practices:**
- Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines
- Use progressive disclosure for large Skills
- Write descriptions that clearly state what and when
- Test with Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus if using multiple models
- Only use Skills from trusted sources (security)

For docs, see [Resources](#resources) → [Official Documentation](#official-documentation).

See: [skills/claude_code/](skills/claude_code/) for Claude Code-specific skill examples.

## Design Patterns

This section is a grab-bag of reusable workflow templates for designing Skills. Use them to improve testability, repeatability, and safety; you generally only need 1–2 patterns per Skill.

### Plan → Execute → Verify
Break tasks into three phases: planning the approach, executing the steps, and verifying the results.

When to use: Tasks that can drift without clear acceptance checks.

### Spec-First Workflows
Define inputs, outputs, and constraints before execution. This ensures clarity and prevents scope creep.

When to use: Output format matters or requirements are likely to change.

### Tool-First Workflows
Prefer structured tools over free-form text when possible. Tools provide better error handling and validation.

When to use: You have CLIs/APIs/tests/formatters available to validate results.

### Critic / Reviewer Loop
Implement self-checking against rubrics or checklists. Have skills review their own output for quality.

When to use: Outputs must strictly follow a checklist or spec.

### Minimal Diff
For code edits, make the smallest safe changes necessary. Avoid refactoring beyond the immediate need.

When to use: You want to reduce risk and avoid unintended side effects.

### RAG-Lite
When researching, quote and cite sources. Maintain traceability from conclusions back to evidence.

When to use: You need to verify facts, quote documents, or reduce hallucination risk.

### Composability
Design skills to work together. Outputs from one skill should be usable as inputs to another.

When to use: You plan to chain multiple Skills into a workflow.

### Idempotency
Skills should produce the same results when run multiple times with the same inputs.

When to use: You want reliable re-runs, regression checks, and predictable outputs.

## Evaluation & Quality

### Quality Checklist

Every skill should address these dimensions:

- **Clear I/O Contract**: Well-defined inputs and outputs with examples
- **Edge Cases**: Handling of boundary conditions and errors
- **Determinism**: Predictable behavior where possible
- **Stop Conditions**: Clear criteria for completion or failure
- **Security Notes**: Awareness of secrets, injection risks, and data safety
- **Example Run**: At least one complete example with expected output
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for users and maintainers

### Testing Recommendations

- **Unit Tests**: For individual skill components
- **Integration Tests**: For skill interactions with tools
- **Golden Files**: Reference outputs for regression testing
- **User Acceptance**: Real-world validation with target users

### Quality Metrics

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of failures or exceptions
- **Performance**: Execution time and resource usage
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from skill users

---

## Security & Safety

### Best Practices

- **Never paste secrets**: Use environment variables and secret managers
- **Treat external content as untrusted**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Least-privilege tool access**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Log and review actions**: Maintain audit trails for automated operations
- **Validate outputs**: Check results before committing or publishing
- **Rate limiting**: Implement throttling for API-dependent skills
- **Data privacy**: Respect user data and privacy regulations

### Common Risks

- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious inputs that hijack skill behavior
- **Data Leakage**: Accidental exposure of sensitive information
- **Unintended Actions**: Skills performing operations beyond their scope
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Skills consuming excessive compute or memory
